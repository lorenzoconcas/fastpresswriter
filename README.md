This is the final project of the course "Fundamentals of Web Programming" (University of Cagliari) for the year 2017/2018

**How to open it?**

Just download the zip file, extract it and open the folder with NetBeans

Alternatively use the git tools of NetBeans itself

**Prerequisites**

 1. NetBeans 8.2 or higher
 2. Glassfish Server installed alongside
 3. Your patience 

**Important Notes**

Even if there are my login information they won't work because the server wich holds the data (the news) is not active anymore
To make it work you must create a server and push the sql schemes you find in "fastpresswriter/Milestone1/web/WEB-INF/db-definition/crea-db.sql" , then put some contents in it

**Additional notes**

The main folder is called "Milestone1" because the project was divided in 4 parts
